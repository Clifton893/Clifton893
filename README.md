My name's Clifton, and I'm a self-taught UX designer. 

After being a chef for seven years, I realized I needed to do more with my life. So I taught myself how to code. For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day, and studied coding before I left for my job at 7:00am. Designing the front end *thrilled* me, and I couldn't learn enough about typography, interface design, color, and visual hierarchy. Then, when I went to a UX Meetup, I realized I'd found my dream career. 

I'm still in the transition phase of my career change, and COVID-19 destroying the economy didn't help me any. But chefs are scrappy, and I **will** succeed. 👍

🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Resetting my financial stability after a 3-month layoff.

🌱 **I’m currently learning:** React.js

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Documentation, research, and visual design.

🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** UI programming, and breaking in as a junior designer.

💬 **Ask me about:** Japanese design principles, typography, and content writing.

📫 **How to reach me:** With this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/6yGdVS7m45tavry59)!

#### ⛩ Fun fact:
My mother and grandmother immigrated from Japan. I speak Japanese (JLPT N5), and majored in Japanese studies. I **love** my heritage. Woodblock prints, kabuki theater, Akira Kurosawa films, Shinto, Zen Buddhism, and Japanese history are major passion points for me.
