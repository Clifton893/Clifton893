Hi, I'm Clifton! I'm a self-taught coder and aspiring UI designer. 

For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day to teach myself how to code, before going to work as a sushi chef. Tinkering on the front-end thrilled me, so I committed to a career change. My goal is to design interfaces that are understandable, helpful, and enjoyable; and interpret them in code. 🤓

## Design & Dev 💻
🌱 **I’m currently learning** React.js

🛠 **I’m currently working on** an article about Zen, Japanese principles, and good UX design.

<!-- Add "Technology Toolbox" section with shields -->

## Writing ✍️
I love writing, and you can find me on Medium. I write about Japanese history & culture, design, and racism.

## Let's Connect! 🌐
*Talk to me about anything! Typography, cooking, Japanese culture, Nintendo, I can chat your ear off....* 😅
