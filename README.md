Hi, I'm Clifton! I'm a self-taught coder and aspiring UI designer. 

For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day to teach myself how to code, before going to work as a sushi chef. 

## Design & Dev 💻
🌱 **I’m currently learning** React.js

🛠 **I’m currently working on** an article about Zen, Japanese principles, and good UX design.

## Writing ✍️
I love writing, and you can find me on Medium. I write about Japanese history, design, and racism.
