My name's Clifton, and I'm a self-taught UX designer. 

After being a chef for seven years, I realized I needed to do more with my life. So I taught myself how to code. For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day, and studied coding before I left for my job at 7:00am. Designing the front end *thrilled* me, and I couldn't learn enough about typography, interface design, color, and visual hierarchy. Then, when I went to a UX Meetup, I realized I'd found my dream career. 

I'm still in the transition phase of my career change, and COVID-19 destroying the economy didn't help me any. But chefs are scrappy, and I **will** succeed. 👍

🔭 **I’m currently working on** a personal/portfolio website, [my blog](https://medium.com/sushi-chef-stories)'s next article, and recovering from a 3-month unemployment period.

🌱 **I’m currently learning** React.js

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Documentation, research, and visual design.

🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** UI programming, and breaking in as a junior designer.

💬 **Ask me about:** Japanese design/arts/history/film, typography, and content writing.
