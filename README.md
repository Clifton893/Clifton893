Hi, I'm Clifton! I'm a self-taught coder and aspiring UI designer. 

For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day to teach myself how to code, before going to work as a sushi chef. Tinkering on the front-end thrilled me, so I committed to a career change. 

My goal is to design interfaces that are understandable, helpful, and enjoyable; and interpret them in code. 🤓

## Tech Toolbox 🧰

🌱 **I’m currently learning** React.js

🛠 **I’m currently working on** an article about Zen, Japanese principles, and good UX design.

## Writing ✍️
Writing has been a lifelong love of mine. You can find me on Medium, where I write about [Japan](https://medium.com/sushi-chef-stories/the-tanabata-festival-ce20e0840142), [design](https://uxdesign.cc/what-being-a-chef-taught-me-about-ux-design-aad1d9b5ab23), and [racism](https://medium.com/@Clifton893/the-problem-with-awkwafina-f8ae3befb08).
