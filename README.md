I'm a self-taught coder, a lifelong writer, and aspiring UI designer. For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day to teach myself how to code, before going to work as a sushi chef. (You can [learn more about me](https://clifton893.github.io/about.html) on my website.)

I'm still in the transition phase of my career change, but chefs are scrappy, and I **will** succeed. 👍
