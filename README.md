I'm a self-taught coder and aspiring UI designer. 

For half a year, I woke up at 4:00am every day to teach myself how to code, before going to work as a sushi chef. Tinkering on the front-end thrilled me, so I committed to a career change. 

My goal is to design interfaces that are understandable, helpful, and enjoyable; and interpret them in code. ü§ì
